Speech-Turn Detection

Accurate and low-latency endpoint detection is crucial for building real-time full-duplex spoken dialogue systems. 
Traditional approaches rely on Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with a fixed delay, but VAD often misinterprets short pauses as endpoints, leading to delayed responses or premature cut-offs. 
This repository provides an implementation of speech turn detection, which takes audio as inputs instead of texts.
